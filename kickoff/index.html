    <h1>Staunton Bitcoin Alliance:<br>Frontier Spirit, Digital Money</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the Staunton Bitcoin Alliance. We gather here with a shared vision: to transform Staunton into a beacon of Bitcoin adoption and financial innovation.</p>

    <p>Our mission is clear and our resolve unwavering. We aim to integrate Bitcoin into the very fabric of Staunton's economic and social systems. This is not merely about adopting new technology; it's about embracing a fundamental shift in how we as a community think about and use money.</p>

    <h2>Our Strategy</h2>
    <p>Our strategy rests on three pillars, each with a specific objective:</p>

    <div class="pillar">
        <h3>1. Citizens</h3>
        <p>Our goal is education. We are committed to empowering everyone in Staunton with a thorough understanding of Bitcoin. Knowledge is the foundation of adoption, and we're here to build that foundation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pillar">
        <h3>2. Businesses</h3>
        <p>We aim to facilitate. By integrating Bitcoin, we offer our local businesses an escape from the burden of high transaction fees imposed by credit cards and banks. This isn't just about savings; it's about fostering a more efficient and prosperous local economy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pillar">
        <h3>3. Government</h3>
        <p>Our objective is integration. We're exploring ways to incorporate Bitcoin into our municipal treasury and as a payment option for city utilities. This bold step could position Staunton at the forefront of governmental financial innovation.</p>
    </div>

    <p>We are Bitcoin-focused. While we acknowledge other technologies, we believe Bitcoin's unique properties make it the ideal tool for achieving true financial sovereignty and local economic resilience.</p>

    <p>Our approach honors Staunton's motto, "Moderata Durant" - moderation endures. We seek not a reckless rush, but a steady, sustainable transformation. Each meeting, each discussion, each decision moves us forward on this path.</p>

    <p>Your participation is crucial. Whether you're a Bitcoin veteran or just beginning to explore its potential, your insights and questions drive our progress. Together, we're not just discussing the future of money; we're actively shaping it.</p>

    <h2>Key Points for Today's Meeting</h2>
    <div class="key-point">
        <strong>1. Respect:</strong> We value diverse perspectives. Listen actively and speak thoughtfully.
    </div>
    <div class="key-point">
        <strong>2. Education:</strong> Every question is valid. We're here to learn from each other.
    </div>
    <div class="key-point">
